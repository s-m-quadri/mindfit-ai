# Mindfit AI

## Overview

MindFit-AI is an open-source project aimed at analyzing and predicting DALY percentages for a comprehensive range of mental health disorders. Leveraging datasets from reputable sources like Our World in Data, the project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically Random Forest regression from scikit-learn, to provide accurate predictions. The covered disorders include schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depressive disorders, and alcohol use disorders. MindFit-AI offers personalized insights, aids in resource allocation and decision-making, and fosters transparency and collaboration as a FOSS project hosted on GitHub.

## Problem Statement

Mental health disorders are a prevalent global concern, affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Existing methods often struggle to provide accurate predictions of the impact of these disorders on DALY percentages, hindering effective resource allocation and support strategies. There is a critical need for data-driven insights to better understand, predict, and address the impact of mental health disorders. MindFit-AI aims to address these challenges by offering accurate predictions and insights on DALY percentages, empowering informed decision-making and improved support strategies.

## Datasets

The project is based on the following datasets:

1. [Prevalence by Mental and Substance Use Disorder](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder): This dataset provides information on the prevalence of mental and substance use disorders across different countries and time periods.

2. [Mental and Substance Use as Share of Disease](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease): This dataset offers insights into the share of mental and substance use disorders as a proportion of the overall disease burden.

Please refer to the respective dataset links for more details and usage guidelines.
